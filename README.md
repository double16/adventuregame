## Play

Visiting the home page will present a list of available worlds. Select one to create a story. Once the story is created a URL will be displayed that can be sent to people to invite to the story.

Click the link, a list of players will be presented. Choose a player, a link will be displayed that enters the story as that player. **Bookmark** this link to continue the story later.

To begin the story, someone must click *start*. Any players not picked will become AI players.

At the end of the story a link is provided to view the story manuscript. This link can be shared and re-visited.
